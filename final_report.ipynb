    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Overview:** This project aims to identify which study habits and lifestyle features most strongly influence student exam scores using a Kaggle dataset. The problem emerged from educators' and students' need to understand the drivers of academic success and to provide actionable guidance for improving learning strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Description & History:** As educators observed large variability in student performance, questions arose about the relative impact of factors like study time, sleep hours, attendance, and tutoring. Understanding these relationships is important to design evidence-based interventions that can boost student outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Source:** The dataset `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv` was obtained from Kaggle, containing fields such as Study Time, Sleep Hours, Attendance, Previous Scores, Tutoring Sessions, and Motivation Level.\n",
    "- **Cleaning Steps Summary:**\n",
    "  - Removed records with missing exam scores.\n",
    "  - Filtered exam scores to make sure none exceeded 100"
